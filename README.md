### Welcome to Stan's Github

You won't see much here. That's because I have my own
[playground](https://gitlab.standyck.com) where I store my personal projects. I have found
that I prefer having my own gitlab server because:

1. I control everything
2. I learn more about lots of different things (server administration/configuration,
   docker, network administration, etc.)
3. It supports a distributive model. Many services everywhere rather than one service in
   one place.
